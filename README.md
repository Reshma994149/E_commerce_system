# E_commerce_system
This Django-based E-commerce recommendation system uses machine learning to suggest products based on user input. It clusters products with K-Means and computes cosine similarity for recommendations. The project includes data scraping, preprocessing, Django views, a user interface, and static files, all running locally with Django.
